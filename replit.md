### Enhanced Pricing Engine with Toilets and Living Rooms Scaling
Extended the domestic pricing calculation to include toilets and living rooms as scaling factors:

**Pricing Additions:**
1. **Toilet Scaling**: Extra toilets beyond 1 add 3% per toilet (capped at 15% for 5+ extra toilets)
2. **Living Room Scaling**: Extra living rooms beyond 1 add 4% per room (capped at 15% for 4+ extra rooms)

**Calculation Logic:**
- Baseline: 1 toilet and 1 living room are included (no extra charge)
- Extra toilets: `price *= (1 + min(0.15, extraToilets * 0.03))`
- Extra living rooms: `price *= (1 + min(0.15, extraLivingRooms * 0.04))`
- Applied in `applyDomesticScaling()` function alongside bathrooms and other property factors
- Multipliers combine multiplicatively with all other scaling factors

**Example Calculations:**
- 2-bed flat End of Tenancy baseline: ¬£160
- With 2 toilets (1 extra): ¬£160 √ó 1.03 = ¬£164.80
- With 2 living rooms (1 extra): ¬£160 √ó 1.04 = ¬£166.40
- With both 2 toilets + 2 living rooms: ¬£160 √ó 1.03 √ó 1.04 = ¬£171.39

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/utils/pricingEngine.ts`: Added toilet and living room scaling with caps in `applyDomesticScaling()` function
- `client/src/components/QuoteForm.tsx`: Already passing `toilets` and `livingRooms` to pricing engine

**Testing Status:**
- Architect review confirmed logic is correct
- Console logging added for visibility (`üíß Extra toilets` and `üõãÔ∏è Extra living rooms`)
- Real-time price updates when form values change

### Multi-Stage Lead Capture System
Implemented comprehensive lead tracking at three critical stages of the quote funnel to capture drop-offs and enable follow-up at every conversion point:

**Lead Capture Points:**
1. **Stage 1 - Personal Details Entry (Step 1)**:
   - Triggers immediately after Step 1 form validation passes
   - Captures: name, phone, email, address, postcode
   - Lead data: `{source: 'website_form_step1', service: 'Not selected yet', value: 0, notes: personal details}`
   - GTM event: `quote_step1_completed`
   - **Purpose**: Track early drop-offs for follow-up before service selection

2. **Stage 2 - Quote Estimate Shown (Step 2)**:
   - Triggers after quote calculation and Step 2 submission  
   - Captures: service type, estimated value, property details
   - Lead data: `{source: 'website_form', service: actual service, value: estimated total, notes: quote details}`
   - GTM events: `quote_completed`, `form_submit`, `lead_added`
   - **Purpose**: Track users who viewed quote estimate but didn't proceed to booking

3. **Stage 3 - Booking Confirmed (Step 4)**:
   - Triggers after successful booking submission
   - Captures: all quote details plus booking date, time slot, and notes
   - Lead data: `{source: 'website_booking_confirmed', service: actual service, value: quote total, notes: booking details}`
   - GTM event: `booking_confirmed`
   - **Purpose**: Track confirmed bookings with complete appointment details

**Technical Implementation:**
- All leads stored in localStorage key: `totalspark_leads_tracker`
- GTM events pushed to `window.dataLayer` for analytics integration
- Shared helper functions (`extractCityFromAddress`, `serviceLabels`, `getBedrooms`) consolidated for consistency
- Lead tracking uses singleton pattern via `getLeadTracker()` function
- Each lead includes UTM parameters, timestamp, and status tracking

**Benefits:**
- Enables follow-up with users who drop off at any stage
- Provides visibility into funnel conversion metrics
- Captures contact details early before users abandon the flow
- Tracks booking confirmations with full appointment context
- All leads exportable to CSV for weekly review

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/components/QuoteForm.tsx`: Added lead capture at Steps 1, 2, and 4 with GTM events
- `client/src/lib/leadTracking.ts`: Lead storage and tracking infrastructure (already existed)

**Testing Status:**
Automated testing confirmed:
- All three lead capture stages fire correctly
- Leads stored in localStorage with proper source attribution
- GTM events pushed to dataLayer with complete metadata
- No duplicate leads on form re-entry
- Booking confirmation shows all three leads with distinct sources

### Quote Form Validation Improvements
Fixed critical form validation issues that were preventing users from progressing through the multi-step quote form:

**Problems Solved:**
1. **Native HTML5 Validation Conflict**: Native browser validation was interfering with React's controlled inputs, causing the form to block progression even with valid data
2. **Overly Restrictive Postcode Validation**: Previous regex pattern rejected valid UK postcodes including BFPO codes and special cases
3. **ObjectUploader Runtime Error**: Uppy cleanup function was calling non-existent `close()` method, causing runtime errors

**Solutions Implemented:**
1. **Custom Validation System**:
   - Added `noValidate` attribute to form element to disable native HTML5 validation
   - Implemented comprehensive custom validation in `handleStep1Submit` function
   - All fields validated with trimming and proper error messages via toast notifications
   
2. **Comprehensive UK Postcode Validation**:
   - Implemented GOV.UK canonical postcode pattern
   - Supports all valid UK postcode formats:
     - Standard postcodes (NE1 1AA, SW1A 1AA, M1 1AA, etc.)
     - Special case (GIR 0AA - Girobank)
     - BFPO codes (BFPO 1, BFPO 1234, BF1 3AA, etc.)
     - Overseas territories (ASCN 1ZZ, STHL 1ZZ, TDCU 1ZZ, etc.)
   - Normalizes input (trim + uppercase) before validation
   - Accepts postcodes with or without spaces
   - Pattern: `/^(GIR ?0AA|((ASCN|STHL|TDCU|BBND|BIQQ|FIQQ|GX11|PCRN|SIQQ|TKCA) ?1ZZ)|(BFPO ?\d{1,4})|([A-Z]{1,2}\d[A-Z\d]? ?\d[A-Z]{2}))$/i`

3. **ObjectUploader Cleanup Fix**:
   - Replaced `uppy.close()` with proper cleanup sequence:
     - `uppy.cancelAll()` - Cancel any ongoing uploads
     - `uppy.clear()` - Clear all files from queue
     - Close dashboard modal if open
   - Prevents runtime errors during component unmount
   - Maintains proper cleanup without destroying Uppy instance prematurely

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/components/QuoteForm.tsx`: Form validation logic and noValidate attribute
- `client/src/components/ObjectUploader.tsx`: Uppy cleanup implementation

**Testing Status:**
Automated testing confirmed that:
- Step 1 validation works correctly with all field types
- Form successfully progresses from Step 1 to Step 2
- All validation error messages display properly
- No runtime errors during normal usage
