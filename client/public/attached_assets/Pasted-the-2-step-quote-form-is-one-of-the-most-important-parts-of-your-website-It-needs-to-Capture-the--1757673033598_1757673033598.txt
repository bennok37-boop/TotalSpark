the 2-step quote form is one of the most important parts of your website.
It needs to:

Capture the lead as early as possible (so you don’t lose abandoned forms).

Be simple and frictionless, while still collecting the details you need to give an accurate quote.

Use conversion-optimised copy (not just bland “Name/Email” fields).

⚡ Conversion Copywriting Tips

Keep CTAs action-oriented:

Step 1: “Next Step: Property Details” (not just “Next”)

Step 2: “Get My Instant Quote”

Use progress bar (Step 1 of 2 → Step 2 of 2) so users know it’s quick.

Save partial leads at Step 1 — you can follow up by phone/email even if Step 2 is abandoned.
