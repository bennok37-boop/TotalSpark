internal linking is the glue that makes your site rank well and convert better. Here’s a clear linking structure for your 5 city pages + 4 service pages.

🔗 Internal Linking Strategy for TotalSpark Solutions
1. City Pages → Service Pages

Each city page should link to all 4 service pages using service cards/blocks + contextual mentions in text.

Example (from /cleaning-newcastle):

End of Tenancy Cleaning in Newcastle → /end-of-tenancy-cleaning

Office Cleaning in Newcastle city centre → /commercial-cleaning

Deep Cleaning for Jesmond flats → /deep-cleaning

Carpet & Upholstery Cleaning for Heaton homes → /carpet-upholstery-cleaning

👉 Do this on every city page (Leeds, Sunderland, York, Middlesbrough).
This ensures each service page receives local SEO link juice.

2. Service Pages → City Pages

Each service page should include a “Areas We Cover” section at the bottom with city-specific links.

Example (from /end-of-tenancy-cleaning):
Areas we cover:

End of Tenancy Cleaning Newcastle

End of Tenancy Cleaning Leeds

End of Tenancy Cleaning Sunderland

End of Tenancy Cleaning York

End of Tenancy Cleaning Middlesbrough

👉 Repeat for all service pages, swapping in “Deep Cleaning” or “Commercial Cleaning” etc.

3. Cross-Link Between Services

Add “Related Services” at the bottom of each service page:

Example (on /deep-cleaning):

Need a move-out clean? → End of Tenancy Cleaning

Looking for workplace cleaning? → Commercial Cleaning

Restore carpets & sofas → Carpet & Upholstery Cleaning

👉 This improves session length (Google likes it) and catches users who clicked the “wrong” service.

4. Blog / Resources (Phase 2)

Later, when you add a blog, link from articles → service pages. Example:

Blog post: “Student End of Tenancy Checklist in Leeds” → links to /end-of-tenancy-cleaning.

Blog post: “Why Offices in Newcastle Need Weekly Cleaning” → links to /commercial-cleaning.

5. Navigation & Footer Links

Top Menu:

Home

Services (dropdown: End of Tenancy, Commercial, Deep, Carpet & Upholstery)

Locations (dropdown: Newcastle, Leeds, Sunderland, York, Middlesbrough)

About

Contact / Get a Quote

Footer Links:

Quick Links: All 4 service pages

Locations: All 5 city pages

Trust: DBS Check, Insurance, Guarantee, COSHH compliance

6. Linking Rules to Follow

Every city page → links to all 4 service pages.

Every service page → links back to all 5 city pages (Areas We Cover).

Service pages also link to each other (“related services”).

Navigation & footer ensure no orphan pages.

7. SEO Benefits

City pages rank for “[service] + [city]” searches.

Service pages rank for “[service] near me / generic UK searches.”

Cross-links help Google understand relevance → boosts rankings faster.

More internal links = higher conversion opportunities (user can always find what they need).

👉 With this, your site becomes a tight local SEO silo:

City pages capture geo-intent traffic.

Service pages capture service-intent traffic.

Cross-linking maximises authority & conversions.
