      question: "How far in advance should I book?",

      question: "What cleaning products and equipment do you use?",

      question: "What happens if I'm not satisfied with the cleaning?",
      answer: "If you're not completely satisfied, we offer a free re-clean within 48 hours. We also provide a full money-back guarantee if the re-clean doesn't meet your expectations. Your satisfaction is our priority."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you clean on weekends and evenings?",
      answer: "Yes, we offer flexible scheduling including weekends and evening appointments to accommodate your schedule. Weekend and evening services may include a small surcharge."

    {
      question: "How do you calculate pricing?",
