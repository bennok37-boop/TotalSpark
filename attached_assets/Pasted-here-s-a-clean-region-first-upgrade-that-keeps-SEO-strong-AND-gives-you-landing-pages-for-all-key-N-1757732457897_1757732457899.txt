here’s a clean, region-first upgrade that keeps SEO strong AND gives you landing pages for all key North East cities & towns.

1) Homepage change (copy you can paste)

Section title: We Cover the North East
Subhead: From Northumberland to Tees Valley — instant quotes, fast scheduling, DBS-checked teams.
Region chips: Tyne & Wear • County Durham • Northumberland • Tees Valley
Prominent cities (tiles): Newcastle • Sunderland • Durham • Middlesbrough • Gateshead • Hartlepool • Stockton-on-Tees • South Shields
Link: View all areas we cover →

(Add a search box: “Find your town…” → typeahead into the landing page list below.)

2) “Areas We Cover” hub (one page)

H1: Cleaning Across the North East

Intro + 4 region sections (anchor links)

A–Z town index + search

Map + “If your area isn’t listed, we likely still cover it—ask for a quote.”

Final CTA: Instant Quote + WhatsApp

3) Mega-menu (Locations) structure

Columns by Region → Cities/Towns (scrollable on mobile).
Keep Yorkshire as a separate “Nearby” group if you still take work there.

4) Landing pages to create (slugs)

Use this pattern for each: /cleaning-<slug>
(You already have full copy templates—we’ll reuse that content structure per town.)

If you still service Leeds/York, keep them under a “Nearby: Yorkshire” group, separate from “North East”.

5) How to build this fast (no dev grind)
Option A: Static site/WordPress

Create one City Landing Template (the Newcastle page you approved).

Duplicate it for each slug; swap city name, local areas, phone number.

Add internal links: each city page links to all 4 service pages + nearby towns.

Option B: Next.js/React (dynamic)

Create /areas/[slug].tsx that reads from a locations.json manifest (name, region, neighbouring areas, phone).

Reuse one component for all towns (auto-inserts city name into H1, FAQs, CTA).

Generate a static sitemap from the manifest.

locations.json (excerpt)

{
  "tyne-and-wear": {
    "display": "Tyne & Wear",
    "cities": [
      {"name":"Newcastle upon Tyne","slug":"newcastle-upon-tyne","phone":"0191 ..."},
      {"name":"Sunderland","slug":"sunderland","phone":"0191 ..."},
      {"name":"Gateshead","slug":"gateshead"}
      // ...
    ]
  },
  "county-durham": { "display":"County Durham", "cities":[ /* ... */ ] },
  "northumberland": { "display":"Northumberland", "cities":[ /* ... */ ] },
  "tees-valley": { "display":"Tees Valley", "cities":[ /* ... */ ] }
}

6) City page content template (drop-in)

Use this for every town (swap {{City}} + 1–2 local references):

H1: Professional Cleaning Services in {{City}}
Subhead: End of Tenancy, Office & Deep Cleans — Instant Quotes in 60 Seconds.
Proof strip: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ • DBS-checked • Fully insured • Deposit-Back/48-hour Reclean
Service cards: End of Tenancy • Commercial • Deep • Carpet & Upholstery
Pricing snapshot: From £120 for 1-bed flats — get your exact price in 60 seconds.
Geo notes: “Serving {{City}} and nearby: {{Neighbour1}}, {{Neighbour2}}, {{Neighbour3}}.”
Local trust bullets: “Supported {{X}}+ landlords & tenants in 2025” (keep generic if no logo rights)
FAQs: coverage, turnaround (24-48h), insurance/DBS, supplies provided, receipts for agents, nearby areas.
Final CTA: Form + Phone (tracked for the region) + WhatsApp.

7) SEO + tracking

Internal links:

Every town page → all 4 services

Services → “Areas we cover” + top towns

Nearby towns cross-link (e.g., Tynemouth ↔ North Shields ↔ Whitley Bay)

Schema: keep Service + LocalBusiness with "areaServed": "North East England" and major city list.

Call tracking: 1 number per region (Tyne & Wear, County Durham, Northumberland, Tees Valley).

Sitemap: include all slugs; submit to GSC.

Canonical: if towns share similar content, keep unique copy lines (neighbourhoods, landmarks, housing types).
