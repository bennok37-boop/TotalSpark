## 📋 Next Steps to Complete Conversion

### Step 1: Install WordPress
You have two options:

**Option A: Separate WordPress Installation (Recommended)**

2. Set environment variable: `VITE_WORDPRESS_URL=https://cms.totalsparksolutions.co.uk`
3. Your main site stays fast, WordPress runs separately

**Option B: Same-Server WordPress** 
1. Install PHP and MySQL on your current server
2. Extract WordPress files to `/wordpress/` directory
3. Complete WordPress installation wizard
4. Import your existing content

### Step 2: Install Required WordPress Plugins
1. **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)** - For custom content fields

2. Activate the "TotalSpark API" plugin  
3. Visit `WordPress Admin > TotalSpark > Import Data`
